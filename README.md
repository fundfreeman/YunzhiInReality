***Contribution is critically needed.***
Mapping graph in other campuses and sample generator need improvement.

## Mapping graph
The mapping graph consists of nodes with geometric location and edges which present a walkable path between a pair of nodes.
To generate a legal path to submit, the first thing is to generate route points that can pass a batch of checkpoints through regular roads.
So a proper mapping graph is essential.

In this version, the mapping graph is declared in [hfutxc_main.py](https://github.com/fundfreeman/YunzhiInReality/blob/main/hfutxc_main.py)

## Sample generator
In Yunzhi 2.0, the locations and corresponded speeds would be submitted.
A sample generator, which is written in C++ now, take responsibility to fulfill moving trace out of the route and make submission more beautiful and reliable.
Generator in any language is welcomed.

Besides, sample speed generated by FakeLocation is pretty noncontinuous, which may be a risk.
