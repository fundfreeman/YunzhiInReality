The packed release is only available for Windows x64 now, and **can only work in the Xuancheng campus**.

# Contribute guide

***Contribution is critically needed.***
Mapping graphs in other campuses and the sample generator need improvement.

## Mapping graph
The mapping graph consists of nodes with geometric location and edges which present a walkable path between a pair of nodes.
To generate a legal path to submit, the first thing is to generate route points that can pass a batch of checkpoints through regular roads.
So a proper mapping graph is essential.

In this version, the Xuancheng campus mapping graph is declared in [hfutxc_main.py](https://github.com/fundfreeman/YunzhiInReality/blob/main/hfutxc_main.py)
Mapping graphs for other campuses or colleges are welcome.

## Sample generator
In Yunzhi 2.0, the locations and corresponded speeds would be submitted.
A sample generator, which is written in C++ now, takes responsibility to fulfill moving trace from the route and make submission more smooth and reliable.
Generator in any language is welcomed.

Besides, the sample speed generated by FakeLocation is pretty noncontinuous, which may be a risk.
